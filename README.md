I'm a systems engineer (DevOps/SRE) in the San Francisco Bay Area who is passionate about automating server infrastructure and delivering high-speed deployments for applications and services, ensuring they are reliable and highly available. I do enjoy speaking in several DevOps-related communities, mentoring people with DevOps, SRE, Infrastructure, and all the tools that fall into all of those various categories.
